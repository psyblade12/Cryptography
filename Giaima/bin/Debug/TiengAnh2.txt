Alone... it is said that those of our kind suffer, separated from the glory of the Khala. But none of us are ever truly alone. For our warrior hearts are bound by honor, tradition. Battle is waged in the name of the many... the brave, who, generation after generation, choose the mantle of... Dark Templar!
